## The idea is to create some sort of web interface where people would be interested in interacting with the performer through the internet and using iot devices 
### first idea is to just create a interactive LED screen at would project words when people text them

### also would be cool to create some sort of other devices controlled by the user, maybe a song picing algorithm
